# Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

## Overview

This interactive web-based tool simulates three fundamental page replacement algorithms used in operating system memory management: First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Least Recently Used (LRU), and Optimal. The simulator provides a visual representation of how these algorithms handle page references, making it an excellent educational resource for students learning about operating systems and memory management concepts.

## Features

- **Multiple Algorithm Support**: Simulate FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement strategies
- **Interactive Interface**: Input custom reference strings or generate random sequences
- **Flexible Input Format**: Enter page numbers separated by spaces or commas
- **Adjustable Frame Size**: Simulate different memory constraints by changing the number of frames
- **Detailed Visualization**: Step-by-step display of how each page is handled in memory
- **Performance Metrics**: View page hits, faults, hit ratio, and miss ratio statistics
- **Color-Coded Results**: Instantly identify page hits and faults with intuitive color highlighting

## How It Works

1. Enter a reference string (sequence of page numbers) or generate a random one
2. Select the number of memory frames available
3. Choose one of the three page replacement algorithms
4. Click "Calculate" to see the simulation in action
5. Review the visualized page replacement process and performance statistics
6. Compare results between different algorithms and frame sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Responsive Design

## Educational Value

This simulator helps visualize the abstract concepts of page replacement algorithms, making it easier to understand:

- How different algorithms make replacement decisions
- The impact of frame size on performance
- The concept of page faults and hits
- The efficiency of different algorithms under various reference patterns

Perfect for computer science students, educators, and anyone interested in understanding how operating systems manage memory resources.

## Future Enhancements

- Export results as CSV or PDF
- Additional page replacement algorithms (Second Chance, Clock, etc.)
- Customizable animation speeds
- Comparative analysis between multiple algorithms simultaneously
- Support for more complex reference patterns
